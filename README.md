# Nihilo
My undergraduate dissertation, such as it is. It should go without saying that in no way, shape or form is it a good idea to use it in production.

## What is this thing?
A small proof of concept for a webassembly based computing platform, handling storage, code execution, and encrypted, signed communication between microcontrollers. 

See this [PDF](/diss/diss.pdf) for 11,000 (or so) words on the topic, including a fun typo in the title that I didn't catch until it was already submitted. The document is basically just chapters of padding around 5.3.1 (Machines) and 5.3.2 (Security Model).
